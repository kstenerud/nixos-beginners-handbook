NixOS Beginner's Handbook
=========================

[NixOS](https://nixos.org/) is a declarative, reproducible approach to system building. The documentation is great if you're an expert, but for beginners it can be very confusing. This guide is intended as a gentle, opinionated, hands-on introduction to NixOS.

Installing
----------

The first question beginners will have is "How do I install this thing?"

As a beginner, you'll want some kind of sandbox to play around in and break stuff before you're ready to entrust your important things, so we'll focus on [installing NixOS in a VM](installing.md).
