How do I install software?
--------------------------

#### nix-env: A word of warning

Many tutorials will instruct you to install software using `nix-env -i <package name>`. **Don't do this!** Install via your configuration files only if you want to maintain determinism! Save `nix-env -i` for later when you understand what's going on under the hood.
